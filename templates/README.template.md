# EasyEDA Extension Registry (${count})

A list of EasyEDA extensions hosted at GitHub, in alphabetical order.

**Note:** if you want to add yours, just send a pull request by following instructions described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Once your extension is added here, it will appear in this list as soon as your pull request is processed (that can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days).
